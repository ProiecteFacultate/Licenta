FAT32:

0. dirEntry->FileSize means the size of the data in the directory clusters. it doesn count only the occupied space in clusters (considering
also 64 for dot & dot dot). It doesn't contain direct or indirect children size!
   when using a method to get full size -> It also counts direct or indirect subdirectories but without 64 (for each of them we decrease
64 from filesize)
   disk on size also counts direct or indirect subdirectories

1.We can find some info about root directory (its first cluster and size in its second entry (starting at index 0)
In root's first sector we have it s name 'Root       ', and in root's children's dot dot entries we also have 'Root     'name.
A normal cluster dotdot entry contains its parent name and its size. For a normal cluster the dot entry DONT contain the cluster size!
Both folders & files contain dot & dotdot

2. Trash cluster : cluster marked as occupied in fat, but without being part of any cluster chain (it can happen in case of some errors)

3. Updating last accesed date and last write time/date
   Last accessed date happens when - add child directory (only for direct child!)
                                   - delete entry from it
                                   - truncate file
                                   - write to file
                                   - read with success from file (some bytes must be read, but no necessarily max bytes)

   Last write date/time happens    - truncate file
                                   - write to file


EXT2:
-WORK WITH SECTORS <= 1024 OR BREAK!!
-Indexare blockurilor se face de la 1 (super blockul primului grup are indexul 1)
-Indexare group blockurilor se face de la 0
-Block size trb sa fie multiplu de sector size (al diskului)! deci nu putem avea un block mai mic decat un sector
-
