EXT2:

What if all groups has same number of free inoed or blocks when looking for a free inode for a new directory?

ALL FILE SYSTEMS!
ON ALL OPERATIONS PROBLEMS MIGHT APPEAR WHEN YOU TRY TO DO SMTH STARTING FROM SECOND SECTOR OF A BLOCK: FOR EXAMPLE read Root/File_1 800 300 
IF YOU HAVE 512 SECTORS AND 1024 BLOCKS YOU WILL NEED TO ACTUALLY READ 2 BLOCKS AND NOT 1 EVEN IF 1 IS ENOUGHT TO FILL AL DATA BECAUSE IT WILL
BE IN 2 SEPPARATE BLOCKS SO ADD 1 AT NUMBER OF BLOCKS TO READ/WRITE
